# A personal front-end template/framework

This is my attempt at coming up with a reusable front-end template/framework for any future web projects I work on. Just a starting block really.

This isn't meant to be massively original in terms of the technical resources & methods used here. A lot of the code here contains stuff I've carefully chosen (and sometimes modified) because of their benefit to my web development projects. However, I certainly won't take sole credit for it. Like most, my thinking has been hugely influenced by other superb developers over the years - for that I'm grateful. This is intended to be an ever changing template/framework of the components I plan to use on an everyday basis.

You're welcome to use it.

## What's in it?

* Top level HTML5 elements.
* Various SCSS partials in a structure that works for me. It includes things like [Normalise.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as well as useful CSS helpers and default print CSS - thanks to [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).
* A [Gruntfile.js](http://gruntjs.com/) strawman for common tasks I use.
* The latest [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) via CDN, with a local fallback.
* The latest [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) build for feature detection. Worth noting that it doesn't have every feature enabled though.
* Protection against any stray `console` statements causing JavaScript errors
  in older browsers - thanks to [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).
* An optimized Google Analytics snippet - thanks to [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).
* Apache server caching, compression, and other configuration defaults for
  Grade-A performance - thanks to [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).
* A simple PHP based application framework.
* Build directory output example.
